# The Moths

>"Hey, Bug-Eyes. I think you got the wrong door, the outfitters is two blocks down."
 
-Anonymous Moth recounting their experience as the first of their kind to walk into a formerly human-only restaurant, following the creation of the Species Equality Act.

## Description:

The Moths originally hail from a world that has since been lost, though how exactly the moths came to forget where their own planet is confuses everyone- everyone, it seems, except the moths. Apocryphal tales of the planet are passed down through generations, describing its remarkable geography- it was tidally locked, and split into two halves as a result- upon the sun-facing side grew a vast jungle, full of life, while on the dark side an arctic wasteland formed, bitter and cold year round. And from these two sides, came two different types of moth- the hardy, cold resistant frost moths, and the lighter, fun loving moss moths. The cultural and physiological differences between the two sides run deep, however they have come to reconcile their differences due to their new living arrangements, aboard the Grand Nomad Fleet.

Mothkind now *mostly* lives aboard the Grand Nomad Fleet, an impressive armada of thousands of ships, from tiny shuttles to hulking capital ships, kept afloat by the combined efforts of every moth living aboard the vessels. In order to keep them running, the moths trade resources harvested from regions the fleet passes by to other civilizations in exchange for crucial parts. Many moths, in support of the fleet, thereby depart from it to work within the ranks of corporations, with the intention of sending money and resources to their families back home. And this is how moths came to live and work alongside the other species of the galaxy.

The moths have had a bumpy past with humanity- following first contact, raids on human vessels by moth pirates were common, however the nature of the attacks was anything but. The moths would arrive, disable the ship, and board, taking as many salvagable parts as they could, all while doing their best to harm nobody aboard their target vessel. Particular preference was given by these fluffy raiders for particularly glowy parts, including (most notably) the ships' uranium power cores, which led to an epidemic of ships being stranded on minimal power in the outer rim for some time. As contact between the two species increased, their piratical ways gave way to trading (most of the time, anyway). In the decades since, moths have become easily the most accepted xeno species by humanity, likely due to their amicable nature and humanlike mannerisms.

As to why the moths have not settled down and founded a colony to serve as a new homeworld, many speculate. Some believe that they are just happy aboard their fleet, and see no need to settle. Others reckon that they're searching for their home planet, to reclaim their lost heritage. Others still believe that the moths are perfectionists, and will accept only a perfect substitute for home. Regardless of their true reasoning, one thing is clear- the moths are here to remain on the galactic stage, and few seem to want this to change.

# Fun Factoids

* Moths are quite sociable, particularly amongst members of their own species, due to living in the tight quarters of the Grand Nomad Fleet.

* The antennas of a moth serve as a receptor for their keen sense of smell.

* Moths have a very keen sense of smell. It is their primary sense for perceiving the world, and they are often big fans of perfumes which they can coat themselves in. Their antennae serve as their main olfactory receptor, as they have no noses. (How do they smell? Like whatever they doused themselves in.)

* Moths are very cute and fluffy, which tends to make them adorable to humans. They are very aware of this fact, and often tend to use it to their advantage.
 
* Their "fluff" is more akin to scales than human hair. It is used for sensory input and will glimmer upon falling off. As a show of dramatism, Moths are known to shake themselves violently to throw off a cloud of shimmering, glittery scales.

* Moth wings are near useless outside of low gravity environments- this does not stop them from priding themselves on their wings and flaunting them around. This is because their wings are particularly precious to them, and most Moths will defend them with their lives.

* Moths are generally not very good in fights. They shock easily, they're susceptible to bright flashes, and so on. Most opt to take the peaceful route instead. When forced to fight, they instinctively scratch rather than bite.

* Some of the more isolated moths have their own religion which is based around space moth deities. These deities appear to represent positive ideals that shine through the darkness of existence and the moths frequently call themselves lightseekers. This religion calls for isolative exploration of the self, which leads adherents to live isolated lives in solitude, counter to moth nature.

* Moths by nature are very considerate of others and this extends to other species. They often think about their companions before they think about themselves. As a result, they also tend to avoid confrontation, and will frequently use flowery or deceptive language when saying negative things about other people.

* By no means do moths believe they can physically intimidate other creatures and instead opt for underhanded tactics.

* Mothra is a very popular hero among the Moth community and most conflicts in Kaiju conventions are usually caused by uppity Moths.

# Racial Tensions

Racial tensions with the Moths have dramatically declined since the initial conflicts of first contact, however this does not mean that everything is peachy between them. Many surveys find that humans are much more positively inclined towards Moths than other xeno lifeforms, and the feeling is mutual. This may be why Moths have managed to dodge the racially-motivated violence that is common to the other xenos.

# Speculations

There has been an uprise in reports regarding attacks on a station situated on a classified frigid location. These reports all mention the same thing: There are feral moths out there besetting the station in an attempt to pull victims into the icy madness below. 

Due to the nature of the attacks, Nanotrasen has decided to keep these attacks on the down low in order to prevent traffic to the area for fear they might scare away signs of what could be the origin of the moth influx. The price they pay is that many unknown staff members may themselves be victim to the strange ire of the angry natives.

The strange part however is the different manner of encounters provided by moths and the rest of the crew. 

All non moth personnel that have witnessed the attacks say the same thing. They're dead silent and drag off their crew mates into the dark blizzards, never to be seen again. They say that the most notable thing about them is their presence. When one of those moths is around, they know. A sense of fear and dread washes over you, followed by the quick ending struggle of their crew members. Never to be seen again.

When moths tell the story however, there's a minor change. They hear them. They claim that the natives somehow echo their voice in a more primitive form of moffic. It rings through their minds, yet that's as far as they go. No moth has been able to establish a manner to communicate with these natives, let alone find them. All they say is that the echoing grows louder as they come nearer, and when they're closeby they can hear the echoes of their victims screaming in agony.
