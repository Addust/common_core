# The Organisation of the TerraGov Armed Forces
The TerraGov military is administered by the TerraGov Joint Military Command- an international organisation formed of the member states of TerraGov for the expressed purpose of coordinating humanity's militaries. The TGJMC is then subdivided into a number of branches and subbranches, ranked in order of size:

1. TerraGov Navy
1. 1. TerraGov Naval Operations Division
1. 2. TerraGov Marine Corps
1. 3. TerraGov Starfighter Corps
1. 4. TerraGov Espatiers Corps
2. TerraGov Army
3. TerraGov Scientific and Exploratory Corps
4. TerraGov Rescue Corps
5. TerraGov Peace Corps

The Navy is the largest and most important branch, being essentially wholly responsible for the bulk of military duties. The Navy flies the ships, the Marine Corps shoots the bad guys on the ground, and the Starfighter Corps handles fighters and air support for the marines.

The Army has lost most of its ground to the dominance of the navy, but still serves an important role in ceremonial duties and security, especially in a responsive role- as army units have no ties to a specific ship, they can be rapidly deployed to any front that requires them, and army soldiers still make up the majority of troops in defensive garrisons or undertaking military policing duties.

The Scientific and Exploratory Corps handles government-mandated scientific expeditions and exploration. This group is only technically part of the military, and functions as a civilian organisation in most ways. The only time they truly earn their stripes is during an active war, at which point they may be called to assist with scouting or technological support.

The Rescue Corps carries on the long traditions set out by the Coastguards of days gone by- maintaining security in space and rescuing people when things go wrong. If you get lost somewhere in deep space, these are the guys who'll be dragging you out of the fire to safety. While their numbers are few, they're very important to maintaining safety in TerraGov's territory.

Finally, the Peace Corps is a uniformed agency dedicated to providing medicinal advice, responding to disasters and emergencies, and generally maintaining the health and safety of TerraGov's citizens. This often sees them coordinating civilian bodies such as the Caduceus Organisation and corporate bodies such as DeForest or Interdyne to effectively distribute aid and organise responses to crises, and also makes them a very important body despite their relatively small size.

### The Citadel
The TGJMC is headquartered at the Citadel- a colossal campus on Long Island for strategising, coordinating, and generally managing an army that needs to maintain territory that spans hundreds of star systems. Understandably, security at this site is exceedingly strong, and most areas are closed off completely to the public.
