# Divisions of Nanotrasen

## Trasen-Knox Scientific
Field: Scientific Computers and Analytical Equipment
A legacy division of Nanotrasen, Trasen-Knox Scientific maintains the company's previous name, as well as its original purpose: high-grade scientific computing and analytical equipment. It's one of Nanotrasen's smallest divisions, but their products are popular with the academic market. Trasen-Knox operates out of Nanotrasen's Southwestern campus at San Jose.

## NTHI (Nanotrasen Heavy Industry)
Field: Resource Extraction and Heavy Industrial Equipment
Originally existing as the German Wulfe Gruppe, NTHI was the first major acquisition beyond computing made by Nanotrasen, starting their upwards climb to being one of humanity's foremost corporations. It's arguably one of the company's most important divisions, being responsible for around 1/3rd of Nanotrasen's overall net worth, as well as managing Nanotrasen's extensive plasma empire. Most of the stations found in the frontier are operated primarily by NTHI, usually with some involvement by NTFID. NTHI's operations are mostly coordinated from Nanotrasen's European regional headquarters, located in Dortmund.

## NTFID (Nanotrasen Frontiers and Innovation Division)
Field: Research and Development

## NTCS (Nanotrasen Chemical Supply)
Field: Chemical Manufacture and Distribution
Another acquisition made in the early days of the company, NTCS began life as Texas Chemical, a major US-based chemical manufacturer. In the centuries since, it's grown to be one of humanity's largest chemical producers, taking advantage of NTHI's dominance in the resource extraction field to produce a wide range of consumer, laboratory, and industrial grade chemicals. NTCS' operations are managed from Nanotrasen's Southern US Headquarters, in Houston

## NTCG (Nanotrasen Consumer Goods)
Field: Consumer Electronics
NTCG is based out of Nanotrasen's Asian regional headquarters in Busan, Korea.
