### The Australicus Sector
A sector in name only, the Australicus Sector is a subdivision of the Trailward Near Rim once used as a penal colony, and today known galaxywide for its hostile conditions, dangerous wildlife, and friendly populace.

Constituting a federation of 9 stars (Kookaburra, Booderee, Adelaide, Elizabeth, King's Star, New Pembroke, Kinross, Topside and Zealandia), alongside a number of outlying territories, the Australicus sector has its own legislature, which represent it as a federal entity at the TerraGov Senate.

### Kookaburra
The capital system of the Australicus Sector, Kookaburra is considered by many to be the least hostile of the systems of the Australicus Sector. It is, naturally, host to the capital planet of the sector, Union, alongside 2 other habitable planets, all of which have mild climates and generally harmless fauna.
