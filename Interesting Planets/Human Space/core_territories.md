## TerraGov Core Territories
The Core Territories are those systems closest to Sol, split between the inner and outer core. This region is well patrolled and generally safe, with a number of important systems scattered throughout.

Officially, the core starts at the borders of the Sol System, and ends at the start of the Close Rim. Alpha Centauri is the closest Core Territory system to Sol.

### Adasta: The Second City of the Empire

#### Fact Sheet:
* Adasta has rapidly become the largest industrial centre in Alpha Centauri, making it one of the most industrialised planets in human space. Though it does not currently rival the Moon or Saturn (although it is close), its current trajectory of expansion suggests that in less than a century it will surpass them.
* This industrialisation is prompted by an incredible mineral wealth. Ore deposits lie near or at the surface, with massive excavations and open pits pulling up billions of credits worth of ore daily. Unfortunately, however, the planet lacks plasma, which makes its ability to keep up with technological advancements limited without imports from Mars, or further afield.
* The shipyards of Adasta are colossal, and the TerraGov navy has plans to set up facilities for the production of the next-generation of capital vessels there- much to the chagrin of the corporations operating on and around the Moon, who are presently responsible for the expansion of the TerraGov navy.

Adasta was one of the greatest finds during Humanity's surveying of the Alpha Centauri system. An Earth-like planet, Adasta was perfect for human colonisation, with passive fauna and edible flora, and a quite survivable, if cold and significantly wet, climate. These conditions have precipitated an explosion of activity, bringing millions of settlers in the centuries since humans first set foot on its surface. Now, it's the main population centre of Alpha Centauri, as well as one of the most populated planets in human space, with well over 8 billion people calling it home.

Adasta, as is perhaps expected for a planet of its importance, is well represented in the senate- in fact, it is overrepresented relative to its population. This is perceived by many to be a deliberate choice to avoid a repeat of the disastrous Martian revolution, particularly as Adasta is now critical to maintaining humanity's industrial and military sectors.

As far as life on Adasta is concerned, the planet is considered by many to be "Earth, but rainier". Modern industrial techniques and technology allow the planet's industry to run cleanly, giving a remarkably low pollution relative to its industrial capacity. While the planet may lack some of the old-world charm of Earth, it more than makes up for it with its modern city design. They say that Adasta City has humanity's best nightlife, as well as some of the best quality of life anywhere in human space. The constant battering rain is a mere inconvenience when every street has a cover.

The twin moons of Adasta, Romulus and Remus, have become true industrial heartlands in much the same way as Earth's own moon, with major shipyards and manufacturing facilities.

### Astarte: A Home in the Clouds

#### Fact Sheet:
* Astarte is another of Alpha Centauri's densely populated planets- a fact that might be surprising given it's a Gas Giant.
* The planet is named for Astarte, the Caananite and Phoenician Goddess of war, romance, and power. This name was picked due to the planet's pinkish hue at sunsets, first observed during initial exploration efforts of Alpha Centauri.
* The upper atmosphere on Astarte is surprisingly breathable, having an atmospheric composition only slightly different to that of Earth. This allows the planet's gas cities to remain open air.
* For a gas giant, Astarte offers a surprising array of biodiversity, with flying animals "swimming" through the upper atmosphere.

Astarte began its life under human influence in much the same way Saturn did- being targeted for potential gas extraction. However, fate would carry the planet in a different direction, as details of its atmospheric composition were discovered. With a composition similar to that of Earth, the planet was functionally useless for large scale skimming, but a different opportunity presented itself- atmospheric shipyards. Offering crews the comfort to work on large ships without requiring EVA gear, the planet became popular for this purpose, with the technology of gas cities being pioneered here. As time went on, the inherent beauty of the planet started to draw another, different, clientele- the rich. Astarte is now one of the most expensive places to live in human space, particularly around its capital of Ishtar, which has gained a reputation to rival Paris as "the city of love". Ludicrously expensive sky-manors and apartment blocks now make up a large portion of the gas-cities of Astarte.

The gas cities of Astarte are sprawling structures made up of a number of colossal interconnected platforms, held at a steady height by atmospheric thrusters. The number of platforms per city varies- Ishtar, the largest, is made up of over 200. Transport between platforms is usually accomplished via flying vessels, though often grounded rail links also offer connections.

### Harvest: Humankind's Breadbasket

#### Fact Sheet:
* The capital city of Harvest is Carter's Prospect, which is also the largest city on the planet, boasting a population of 750,000. The city is particularly green, with numerous parks and open spaces, and very little of the city has buildings above a few storeys.
* The planet as a whole has a population of 6 million, spread across the extremely fertile central band. Fewer live in the vast forests of the north and south.
* Harvest is an Agriworld, with an economy very strongly based upon farming. Food from Harvest feeds humanity throughout the galaxy, with millions of tonnes being produced per annum. Other economic sectors include mining, logging and tourism.
* The several moons of Harvest are barren, and as such are unpopulated.

Harvest, in the Demeter system, is one of Humanity's more important colonies, due to the incredible fertility of the soil there. Classified as an Eden planet, Harvest has a perfect atmosphere for humanity, as well as a remarkably mild climate. By all accounts, it was a perfect planet for humankind to settle, and humans have taken excellently to life there. The population is austere, hard-working and communal, and the people pride themselves on this fact, viewing offworlders with a degree of suspicion. Rural areas are dominated by colossal farms, producing huge quantities of food crops, as well as large amounts of animal products. In urban areas, food processing plants are common, turning the harvest from the countryside into high quality products to be shipped across the galaxy.
