## Curiosity kills the cat

Not long ago, Nanotrasen scientists discovered the secret of cheating death. Cloning technology was one of the many great scientific advancements of the 26th century, allowing those rich (or lucky) enough to have access to it to be returned to life in the event of their untimely demise. The technology was, understandably, heralded as a miracle for modern medicine, but beneath the surface lurked a dangerous secret.

It was known during development that the genetic code that is used by cloning to reconstruct the body was exceptionally fragile, and even the smallest impurities in the reagents used for the process could result in genetic deformities. Usually, these deformities manifested as small, undetectable issues- a little change here, a loss of function there, perhaps a "healthy" dose of cancer. But what could happen if there was a large scale contamination? Scientists had been limited in their capacity for experimentation in this field by regulations against human experimentation, but it was theorised that it would cause massive, irreversible damage to their genes. Unfortunately, this theory would finally be proven accurate on Monday, the 14th of January, 2560.

Fluffles the Kitten, the faithful pet of the shift chief at the Nanotrasen-Pauling Chemical Plant on Prosperity, had found her way into her owner's bag that morning, and therefore ended up in the plant. Wandering around, she found herself at the reactor being used to produce Hyperclone Reagent B, an acidic slurry used as one of the cloning chemicals, which was presently having QA samples removed for lab analysis. And, as they say, curiosity kills the cat. As the last sample was removed, Fluffles jumped through the open hatch and into the tank, and was sealed in by the unaware worker. And so, an entire batch of Hyperclone Reagent B was contaminated with cat DNA, and nobody would be the wiser. This plant serviced every Nanotrasen cloning clinic within the Home sector, as well as several Spinward Stations which were experimenting with new cloning techniques, and over the next few weeks, they would each receive their new shipments.

And so, nothing seemed to be wrong, until the 28th of that month, 2 weeks after the incident.

Customers who had been cloned were found to be developing alarming side effects. There were the large and obvious ones, of course. The ears. The tails. Fixations on bright lights. But also a number of more subtle changes were observed too- altered mental states, changed tastes, new personalities. These people were no longer human, but mutant. Felinid.

Of course, this prompted a massive outcry by the public, as these changes were far too large scale to cover up. Nanotrasen's immediate response was to close all cloning clinics immediately, and begin an investigation as to what went wrong. Before long, the root cause was discovered, as cleaners at the Prosperity plant found bones in the tank. Knowing that the public would never regain trust in the process following an incident of this scale, Nanotrasen officially permanently closed all cloning facilities on the 4th of February, 2560, and cancelled all official research into the technology. Cloning would remain in use by the company afterwards, but only internally with exceptionally tight quality control.

## Adapting to the new

So, what did these mean for those affected by the accident?

The immediate response was one of disgust. The felinids were treated in much the same way as the aliens of the galaxy- pushed down to being second class citizens, discriminated against by those they once knew as friends, or coworkers, or lovers. Many were driven into dark places by the hatred.

And yet, soon, opinions changed. Within only a few months, the efforts of dedicated civil rights activists managed to change public perception of the Felinids as a whole. "These people are not aliens, nor monsters," they said, "merely victims of circumstance. Are we so heartless as to hate them for that which they had no control over?" Felinids would reconcile with humanity, as a distinct, yet closely entwined, species- though distrust would remain.
