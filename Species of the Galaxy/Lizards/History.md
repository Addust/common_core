### The Valyngian Decree: The Most Significant Event in Tiziran History
In Tiziran history, there are a wide range of significant historical events which dictated lizardkind's path through the ages. From the foundation of the Empire on the Minosk, to the discovery of the New World, and even the Human/Lizard wars, Tizira's history is long and storied, but academics (almost) universally agree on a single event as the most significant in Tiziran history: The Valyngian Decree.

The Valyngian Decree, or the Decree of Succession of the Kingdom of Valyngia, actually occurred during the start of the Industrial age, with the passing of the final King of Valyngia, but the seeds were sown for it centuries before, with the advent of the Tiga Alliance- a pact of mutual defense and friendship between the larger, more militarily focused Valyngian state, and the smaller, weaker Grand Duchy of Surenose. As the centuries went by, Surenose expanded across their home island, eventually unifying with its neighbours into the United Kingdom of Oskmarzel, which would go on to become a powerful contender in the colonial races of the early modern era. Throughout this time, the old alliance held strong, and the two nations became very close- so close, in fact, that with the final King of Valyngia approaching death without an official heir, he instead decreed that the Kingdom would pass to the King of Oskmarzel instead. The nobility of Valyngia agreed, and so with the death of the King, the two nations would be bound together under personal union, and these ties would be formalised into a true union of states a few decades later.

The timing of these events is pivotal in making the Decree so significant. The personal union came into being at the beginning of what would become Tizira's consolidation period, roughly a century before the true Wars of Unification started. With it, the previously small Ozkmarzelic state inherited one of Tizira's largest and most effective standing armies, as well as a significant boon to their economic and political standing amongst the great powers. In short, this event catapulted an unlikely candidate to the forefront of Tiziran politics, and granted them the military and economic prowess required to begin to expand their influence aggressively. By the time the Wars of Unification arrived, Oskmarzel was the dominant power on Tizira, and as such had the capacity to win wars and bring Tizira under their banner.
