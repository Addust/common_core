# Sitalesse: The Worship of the Heavens
The largest religion on Tizira, Sitalesse (Draconic, Sky Worship) is a polytheistic faith revolving around the worship of celestial bodies, subdivided into a number of subfaiths that place importance on specific deities. Having originally been born of the regions surrounding the Minosk, the religion was carried further afield by Classical-age imperial conquests, and then further again by colonialism. At the religion's peak in the Industrial Age, around 50% of the population of Tizira followed some form of Sitalesse. By the time of the settlement of Sulya, this number had dropped to about 30-35%. Now, following centuries of space travel, the rise and fall of Lacertism, and a general shift from devout religious practice, the religion is followed by only around 25% of the planet's population, and less so in the colonies.

The principal subfaiths of Sitalesse are those that follow Atrakor, Tizira, Rizkalon, Sulya, Viomea and the Twin Moons Pelara and Iskil.

### Atrakor: The Warrior and Guardian
Within the Sitalesse Pantheon, Atrakor, the Night Sky Lord, represents military might, chivalry, honour, duty, and acts as the guardian of the souls of the dead. This commanding position, particularly with the emphasis on militarism within Tiziran society, places the Moon Father and his cult as the primary deity of the Sitalesse pantheon in Tiziran culture, despite his position within the pantheon not being at its head.

The importance of Atrakor has resulted in moon iconography being common within Tiziran culture. The Empire's flag, as an example, displays Atrakor in full illumination, typically associated with military might. This same icon appears on the royal coat of arms, with Atrakor being considered the patron deity of the royal family. Other phases carry other meanings- Atrakor's New Moon, for example, is associated with the dead and revering their eternal souls, and is considered the Holy Day (or night, as the case may be) of the Moon God, being an important prayer day and marking the end of a Tiziran week. To this end, the emblem of the New Moon is often found on ossuaries, and adorning the walls of burial catacombs across the empire.

Temples dedicated to Atrakor are common across the Empire, particularly around the Old World side of the Zagosk where Atrakor worship was most prevalent (and that would go on to be the heartland of the Tiziran Empire). Some of the most impressive include the Imperial House of the Moon in Zagoskeld and the extensive temple complex of the Halls of Atrakor in the foothills of the Adeni Mountains near Taraveiro.

### Tizira: The Earth Mother
Tizira, the Earth Mother, is regarded as the spiritual creator of lizardkind, forming an integral part of the Sitalesse creation myth. She is said to have been created by Rizkalon and the unknown King of the Cosmos to serve as lizardkind's mother and home, serving her children through her bountious gifts. She subsequently went on to birth the first lizards, and then entered an eternal slumber, content knowing that she would provide for her children through the ages. This important role has made her a common icon of worship

### Sulya: The Mother of Hearth, Home, Harvest, Athletes and Competition
One of the lesser deities of the pantheon (but no less worshipped), Sulya holds domain over a wide variety of facets. Of these, she is most associated with hearth and home, being the goddess of domiciles, warmth, and family. This makes her an important icon for home shrines, maternity wards, nurseries, and other similar places. Additionally, her domain over the harvest makes her a key goddess in the rural regions of Tizira where farming is a key source of income- indeed, it is these areas that hold most of her primary temples and monasteries.

She also holds domain over a very different facet: competitions. Here, she serves as the patron goddess of athletes, for theological reasons lost to time. For this reason, her iconography of the White Coastflower and the Korta Nut is commonly used in sports, including being the symbol for the Sulyanic Games- a global event similar to the human Olympics.

#### Fun Facts:
* The most famous depiction of Sulya is in the painting "Sulya Anoints Her Champion", a piece depicting her pouring water over an armoured figure. The piece created controversy at the time of its creation due to its immodest depiction of the goddess, but has since become a landmark piece in Valyngian culture.

### Viomea: War, Victory, and Metal
Viomea's domain over war, victory and metal has netted her a prime pantheonic position amongst the war-hungry Tizirans. As the patron goddess of soldiers, her icon (the Bloodrose) is used commonly across the armed forces, often alongside Atrakor's full illumination.
