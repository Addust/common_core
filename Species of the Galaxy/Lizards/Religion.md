# Sitalesse: The Worship of the Heavens
The largest religion on Tizira, Sitalesse (Draconic, Sky Worship) is a polytheistic faith revolving around the worship of celestial bodies, subdivided into a number of subfaiths that place importance on specific deities. Having originally been born of the regions surrounding the Minosk, the religion was carried further afield by Classical-age imperial conquests, and then further again by colonialism. At the religion's peak in the Industrial Age, around 50% of the population of Tizira followed some form of Sitalesse. By the time of the settlement of Sulya, this number had dropped to about 30-35%. Now, following centuries of space travel, the rise and fall of Lacertism, and a general shift from devout religious practice, the religion is followed by only around 25% of the planet's population, and less so in the colonies.

The principal subfaiths of Sitalesse are those that follow Atrakor, Tizira, Rizkalon, Sulya, and the Twin Moons Pelara and Iskil.

### Atrakor: The Warrior and Guardian
Within the Sitalesse Pantheon, Atrakor, the Night Sky Lord, represents military might, chivalry, honour, duty, and acts as the guardian of the souls of the dead. This commanding position, particularly with the emphasis on militarism within Tiziran society, places the Moon Father and his cult as the primary deity of the Sitalesse pantheon in Tiziran culture, despite his position within the pantheon not being at its head.

The importance of Atrakor has resulted in moon iconography being common within Tiziran culture. The Empire's flag, as an example, displays Atrakor in full illumination, typically associated with military might. This same icon appears on the royal coat of arms, with Atrakor being considered the patron deity of the royal family. Other phases carry other meanings- Atrakor's New Moon, for example, is associated with the dead and revering their eternal souls, and is considered the Holy Day (or night, as the case may be) of the Moon God. To this end, the emblem of the New Moon is often found on ossuaries, and adorning the walls of burial catacombs across the empire.
