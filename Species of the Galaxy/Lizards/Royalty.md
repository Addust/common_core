# The Tiziran Monarchy: Tradition, Ambition, and Fraction

## Introduction
Tizira today stands as a constitutional monarchy- the monarch acts as a figurehead with limited constitutional power, with the vast majority of true ability to affect change having been signed off to a secondary governing body. In the case of Tizira, this secondary body is the Imperial Parliament.

## History
The first concepts of the Tiziran "Universal Monarchy" predate true recorded history, with the first attempt at consolidation of large amounts of territory occurring in the Empire on the Minosk circa 2500BC (to use human terms). Such heights have been exceeded since, naturally, with examples such as the colonial conquests of the late medieval, early modern, and industrial eras seeing large scale territorial conquest- however, strong forces of nationalism coupled with the emergence of multiple contenders at any given time lead to a failure to consolidate the prize of Tizira itself. Indeed, it was not until the inheritance of the Valyngian throne by the King of Oskmarzel (and the subsequent merging of the two largest colonial empires on Tizira's surface) that any one state would set itself out as a likely inheritor to the planet itself. The Wars of Consolidation and Unification would, in turn, see Oskmarzel take the top spot, and place their dynasty on the throne of a unified Tizira, taking the regnal name "Rena" to signify this dominance.

The current monarch, Empress Rena-Dael I, is of the Rena Dynasty, but not of the same house that unified Tizira- the original lineage died out in the 2200s, seeing the ascendancy of a cadet branch that had been granted indefinite viceroyalty over Valyngia, the Rena-Valyn.

## The Empress
The story of Empress Dael is a tragic one at best. Historically significant as Tizira's youngest monarch in nearly 300 years, her ascendancy to the throne at age 26 came, naturally, with the death of the previous monarch, her father, who is *also* historically significant for being the youngest Tiziran monarch at the time of his death, at age 48.

Throughout her childhood, the Empress was known for her dissatisfaction with royal life, often being known to sneak out of the palace and exploring an unsanitised view of Tizira, typically alongside her twin brother.
