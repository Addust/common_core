### Peliskpalo: The Tiziran Ball Game
Peliskpalo (Game of War) is Tizira's "national" sport, played planetwide and popular amongst lizards of all colours, creeds and regions. Originally developed as a martial training exercise in the medieval period, the game would develop throughout the ages, with a standardised ruleset coming into play, alongside tournaments, and leagues. The first professional league was founded in the midst of the Industrial Revolution in Oskmarzel, and from there the game would take the world by storm.

#### Rules:
Peliskpalo is a team ball game, played with 8 players per side. The rules are simple: get the ball to the opposing end of the court. The ball can be moved by the use of any body part, but it cannot be held in the hands, nor can it move backwards. Should the ball move backwards more than one progression line, possession is relinquished to the other team. Contact is allowed, although in professional settings it is kept moderated to a low level (similar to rugby).

A regulation Peliskpalo court is approx 80 metres long and 40 metres wide, with progression lines placed every 5 metres. At either end is a score zone, into which the ball must pass to score a point. The ball is a solid cork ball coated in rubber, set at a regulation size of roughly 6 inches in diameter (roughly 19 inches in circumference). This produces a relatively heavy ball when compared to air-filled examples from Earth.

Players wear only light protection, usually restricted to thin pads on sensitive areas.

### The Tiziran Currency
To understand Tiziran currency, it is first important to understand lizard mathematics- owing to the lizard physiology of 4 fingers per hand, many number systems on Tizira throughout history were to a base 8, instead of humanity's 10. From this, a hexadecimal number system developed to base 16, and this is today used across the planet. Lizard currency, therefore, is also to a base 16. The Tiziran Rena, or Crown, is the only official legal currency on Tizira, although Universal Credits are also frequently accepted by larger companies and in major cities.

A complex systems of coins dominates the Rena, with coins representing fractions of a full Rena. The smallest increment is the sekata (half kata), which is 1/32th of a pelata or 1/512th of a rena. From there, the increments build up as such:
1 kata (pewter) = 2 sekata (1 k)
1 selkata (two kata) = 2 kata
1 talkata (four kata) = 4 kata
1 yalkata (eight kata) = 8 kata
1 pelata (iron) = 16 kata (1 p, 1/-)
1 korta (gold) = 32 kata = 2 pelata (2 p, 2/-)
1 alsan (sword) = 64 kata = 4 pelata (5 p, 5/-)
1 serena (half rena) = 128 kata = 8 pelata (10 p, 10/-)
1 rena (crown) = 256 kata = 16 pelata (1 r, 20 p, 20/-)

Currency below a few rena is frequently expressed as pelata/kata, as these are fairly convenient coins to carry. Rena notes exist to the base 16, in order of 8 rena, 16 rena, 32 rena, etc.
